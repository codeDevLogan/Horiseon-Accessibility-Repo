# Horiseon

## Description

The homepage of Horiseon's website needed an accessibility update. I took on the project to address that issue. The website solves the problem of providing professional advice on search engine optimization. The problem my update solves is the need of further accessibility. I learned alot about concise alternative text for the images.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The site can be used to study techniques on search engine optimization. The navagation bar can be used to click through the different sections.
